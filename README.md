What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]

Your answer:

The constructor is the special method which is used, when an object is initialized. you can create constructors with initial values, or the objects values can be given when the cunstructor is called.
When a subclass' cunstructor is called, the constructor of its superclass is also called automatically
If no user defined constructor is provided for a class, compiler initializes member variables to its default values.

What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]

Your answer:

Functions are defined outside of classes, while Methods are defined inside of and part of classes.
A method is a function which belongs to an object.
A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on.
Related to java we can not really talk about functions, java only have methods.
